	<h2>Giant Panda bears</h2>
	
	<h3>
	
	Giant pandas, often referred to simply as pandas, are widely regarded as the most endearing bear species, 
	thanks in part to their unique white and black fur coats, which serve both camouflage and thermal regulation functions. 
	While pandas possess the ability to consume meat, their diet primarily revolves around bamboo. To compensate for the 
	lower caloric value of bamboo, these magnificent creatures spend approximately 12 hours a day engaged in feeding 
	activities, ensuring they obtain sufficient energy to sustain themselves. A typical female adult panda weighs around 
	200 pounds, while males can weigh around 190 to 275 pounds.

	<h2>Cinnamon bears</h2>
	
	<h3>Cinnamon bears, a color morph of the American black bear, are visually striking with their distinct 
	cinnamon or reddish-brown fur. Found primarily in the western regions of the United States and Canada, 
	these bears inhabit a range of habitats including forests, mountains, and brushlands. Their omnivorous diet 
	consists of berries, nuts, fruits, insects, and occasionally small mammals. Cinnamon bears, like their black 
	bear counterparts, possess excellent climbing and swimming abilities. In terms of size, adult males can weigh 
	between 200 to 600 pounds (90 to 270 kilograms), while adult females typically weigh around 100 to 400 pounds 
	(45 to 180 kilograms). While they are not considered a separate conservation concern, specific populations of 
	cinnamon bears, as with other black bear populations, may face localized conservation challenges.
